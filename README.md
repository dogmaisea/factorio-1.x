Factorio 1.x 10.8k Blueprints by Dogmai
  (DogmaiSEA || Dogmai - South East Asia: Servers)

Each blueprint is seperated into Parts (P1) and/or (P2) and a "final build".

P1 = Powerlines, input belts, output belts and corner beacons.
P2 = Same as Final Build but without the beacons.
Final Build = The entire build, most of which will have to be done by Spidertrons.

All (Nx) numbers in the builds reference the total amount of compressed blue belts needed.

These builds are dedicated to my children, I removed all the little love notes I wrote for them from this version posted on github,
but with 2.0 making most of these builds obsolete, there is no better time than to share them with the entire world.

My computer cannot run a 10.8k factory, but theoritically this should all work, all you need to do is to connect the belts, if you
ever actually use my builds, send me a message on reddit (DogmaiSEA) or email me @gmail.com, and let me know what you accomplish.

Each Science Build is split into 4x Output Lanes, so this build can be done in stages; 2.7k, 5.4k, 8.1k and 10.8k, by simply deleting
what is not required at the time, all Science Builds are tileable, so you could go even bigger as well.

:: Regarding the Train Station Designs ::

The Train Station design used in all my builds is unique, as far as I know I am the only person to design one such as this, designed in June 2022.

It works by using trains as a buffer, each Train Station can be thought of as two independent 4 engine train stations positioned next to each other,
this can be visualized by looking at the differences between Steel Burner B and Steel Burner C.

The idea behind it was that I wanted Train Stations that actually looked like a real life train station, so that you had all these trains come into
the build and park next to each other whilst offloading their goods, a little bit like Grand Central Terminal or something along those lines.

Yes there are belts that don't do anything, this was done to make it look beautiful. If you are building one of these stations then the cost of a few
belts and undergrounds will mean absolutely nothing to you. It can be downgraded to Red Belts; however Yellow Belts would require some additional
underground belts between the outermost inserters, should work with Green Belts and should theoritically still be able to compress them.

Each set of 4x Cargo Wagons can output either 1-4 compressed blue belts, this is a variable amount and this is important as it allows the same station
design to be used when specific ratios are required for certain builds, such as;

Direct Insertion (Design B) Iron Ore -> Steel, where the ratio is 6:1;
  4 Blue Belts Iron Ore Train compress to 3 Blue Belts Iron Ore
  6 Blue Belts Iron Ore output 1 Blue Belt Steel

Where a normal Steel Burner is a 5:1 Ratio (Design A);
  4 Blue Belts Iron Ore Train compress to 2 Blue Belts Iron Ore
  4 Blue Belts Iron Ore split into 5 Blue Belts Iron Ore
  5 Blue Belts Iron Ore output 1 Blue Belt Steel

So despite requiring different ratios, the train station can cope with the change without changing it's design.

:: Oil Refinery ::

I have a 95% complete and working Oil Refinery to supply this base, as well as Plastic creation, however I never finished bug checking it, and
from memory there is still a few small bugs left to work out. When I get time I will finish it and add it to this blueprint, the train station design
is similar to the one used for ores, however instead of being 2|2|2|2 trains next to each other, it is 2|2 |   | 2|2 |   | 2|2 trains.

Still using 8-32-8 trains, cause they look cool.

-----------------------------
10.8k Lab
-----------------------------
>> Input:   4x Compressed Blue Belts of each Science

The railway in the middle of the lab was built for my children to drive a train around and not
interfere with the running of the base, it is not needed otherwise, and is purely aesthetical.

-----------------------------
64L Green Circuits (172.8k) ++ TRAIN INPUT
-----------------------------
<< Output:  64x Compressed Blue Belt - Green Circuits

>> Input:   4x 8-32-8 Trains of Iron Ore or Iron Plates
            4x 8-32-8 Trains of Copper Ore or Copper Plates

For 10.8k you need: 3 :: 166 lanes for 10.8k, extra 2.75 lanes for Mall, rest for extra Red Circuits + Blue Circuits for Mall.

I would have one of these Train Stations near the Red Circuits, and two near the Sciences, Blue Circuits and RCU, 
but you would still have to steel 2 lanes of Green Circuits from the Red Circuits.

-----------------------------
5.4k Red Circuits
-----------------------------
<< Output:  2x Compressed Blue Belt - Red Circuits

>> Input:   3x Copper Plates
            3x Green Circuits
            3x Plastic

For 10.8k you need: 17 (+3 = 20) :: 34 lanes for 10.8k, extra 4.5 lanes for Mall, rest for extra LDS + Blue Circuits for Mall.

-----------------------------
2.7k Blue Circuits
-----------------------------
<< Output:  1x Compressed Blue Belt - Blue Circuits

>> Input:   14.5x Green Circuits
            1.5x Red Circuits
            1x Sulfuric Acid Pipe

For 10.8k you need: 5 (+1 = 6) :: extra 1 for Mall.

-----------------------------
9.1k Rocket Fuel
-----------------------------
<< Output:  3.4x Compressed Blue Belt - Rocket Fuel

>> Input:   6x Light Oil Pipes

This is enough for a 10.8k build, the 3 Compressed Blue Belts are for the Rocket Parts, the other two output belts are
prioritized for Satellite, and then Train Fuel.

-----------------------------
12 Satellites per Minute
-----------------------------
<< Output:  12 - 15 Satellites per Minute

>> Input:   0.5x Blue Circuits
            0.5x Low Density Structures
            0.5x Solar Panels
            0.5x Accumulators
            0.2x Rocket Fuel
            0.02x Radars

-----------------------------
2.7k Rocket Control Unit
-----------------------------
<< Output:  1x Compressed Blue Belt - Rocket Control Unit

>> Input:   1x Blue Circuits
            4x Red Circuits
            4x Green Circuits

For 10.8k you need: 3.

-----------------------------
2.7k Low Density Structures
-----------------------------
<< Output:  1x Compressed Blue Belt - Low Density Structures

>> Input:   16x Copper Plates
            4x Plastic
            2x Steel

For 10.8k you need: 6 (+1 = 7) :: extra 1 for Mall.

-----------------------------
32L Steel (86.4k) ++ TRAIN INPUT
-----------------------------
<< Output:  32x Compressed Blue Belt - Steel

>> Input:   8x 8-32-8 Trains of Iron Ore

For 10.8k you need: 2 :: 50 lanes for 10.8k, extra 14 lanes for Mall.

There are three different Steel Burners;
  A  -  The most beautiful one, split outputs facing downwards.
  B  -  Direct Insertion with outputs on the side.
  C  -  Direct Insertion with outputs in the middle, this one is ugly, I am not proud of this one.

The trains act like buffers, eg A: 4x trains output 2x belts of ore, and 4x belt of ore splits into 5 belts, which outputs 1 belt of steel.

It is possible to run a 64L burner off this size Train Station, but it would be twice the size, and given that you need exactly 32L of Steel
for Purple + Yellow Science, I think it is better to have two of these stations, and place each one on different sides of the build.
